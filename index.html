                    <p>Why so much misery, my heart bleeds for her bloods are seen on her skirts 
                        <br>She hides her face in shame simply because she can’t raise her standards to others
                        <br>She still depends on others for survival she can’t stand on her own
                        <br>Her wings have been clipped off 
                        <br>The eagle full of strength who could cause an earthquake when she moved her wing
                        <br>She is the giant of other territories, Her territory is full of resources.. but she doesn’t know it’s worth. She is a literate but at the same time a full illiterate. She downgrades herself not being able to develop her potentials she choose to sell them off…. she is full of knowledge and beauty… I mean what does she lacks, but all that has been shattered because of the governance of her mind. Her choice of company is very poor, she allows unhealthy minded people around her. 
                        <br>Most people coming to her just want to take advantage and shatter her completely. Her Natality rate is increasing day by day. She doesn’t reward her children but she pushes them away, she can’t protect them but rather puts them in more harm. 
                        <br>And you know………we have to suffer all this.
                        <br>In most cases, we have been seen as trash, like garbage who in their own perceptive the need to cater is been diminished, we have treated as alternative forgone, resources are scare when ever our names are mentioned. 
                        <br>Our needs have never been projected towards an equilibrium point for a cause for alarm. She shows great partiality to her children some of us mean nothing……..
                        <br>But the most prevailing circumstance is that we accelerate uniformly having God’s Grace, we accelerate to an altitude where her injustice fades away, simply because our altitude out weighs her objectives. 
                        <br>For a gazillion time in our ramification, we triumph regardless of the menemene chepechepe circumstances, we are antidotes to her poison, antivirus to her malicious wares, our OS is relentless with an encrypted BIOS settings, the equation of how we survive has become a mystery, our equation can’t be balanced. Homologous series have members of 14g but we differ by approximately a gazillion gram. Our formula is so mighty with grace embedded in it. We are indeed strong and resistant to all oppositions. Her state of friction cannot overcome our force. Gravity tends to pull us down but we accelerate with an increasing velocity greater than that of an escape velocity. She derives pleasure in deforestation but we created a million times of what she destroyed. 
                        <br>We sieve out the obsession she tries to imbibe us with. We have a rare hormone, a strong and dominate one, having a dominate gene of GG, I call it God’s Grace.
                        <br>I salute to all her children, we are indeed strong and gallant to all her stormy difficulties but one thing here is that we can’t kill her, we can only pray for our mother NIGERIA.

                        <p>Too much love…………
                            <br> much love …. is what he showers on me 
                            <br>He suffocates me with his love but …. not as that of the mixture of carbon monoxide and haemoglobin in the human blood ooh…...
                            <br>His love is the mixture of grace and mercy which produces a cloud of blessings. I call it Agape, I call it mania. See situations don’t shake me because he is always there to solve them. No equation is hard for him to balance. See he is not man that has to ask for someone’s permission to solve my problems. Check this, he created everything with the words of his mouth. He said let there be light, let there be night, let the lands separate from the waters. With the words of his mouth mountains, trees, animals, and many others came into form. 
                            <br>But when it got to my specie it changed you know…... He didn’t even do it on his own He seek the assistance of the Son and The Holy Spirit. He said let us make man…. He moulded me in his own image and likeness, as if that was not enough, he blew in me the breathe of life. I mean…... why didn’t he give that privilege to animals or plants why ….. me?
                            <br>See he gave me authority to trample upon snakes and scorpions. But with all this, he didn’t force me to serve him, he gave me a choice between life and death…….so??
                            <br>Which should I follow??? Am I going towards the right direction???
                            <br>Where am I?? Why does it feel so dark and void…? ohh no no no I went the way …...I…I…. am in sin nooooo…… I can’t forfeit the love, the care, the blessings and abundant grace…. I have to find my way out of here who will help me???
                            <br>Will my father still forgive me??
                            <br>I chose to be a prodigal child but I accept my fault am so sorry dad, show me your mercy Lord….
                            <br>Take me out of this misery the darkness, the hurt I can’t even explain
                            <br>Life feels so void without you dad.</p>

                            <p>I was….. <br>There I was in a verge and pillars of my greatest demise <br>Having seen my enemies shouting and yelling in great joy 
                                <br>In that same state of agonizing moment, my mind, heart and soul seize to communicate
                                <br>I felt mystery has come to stay
                                <br>My artery and vein collectively stopped performing their function of both taking blood into and away from my heart 
                                <br>I could see through the lines but my brain finds that geometry pretty hard to interpret
                                <br>The feeling of taking away this pain became my priority and highest form of concern /p>
